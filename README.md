# Machine-Learning-Algorithms
Implementations of popular machine learning algorithms using Python, including:
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest (using bagging and information gain)
- Logistic Regression (using l2 regularization and gradient descent)
- K-Means
- Gaussian Mixture Model (using Expectation Maximization)
- Artificial Neural Network (with Fully Connected layers)
  
Each implementation includes an example. For the Jupyter Notebooks, you can see the example here on Github. For the python scripts, you can run the examples by downloading the scripts and running them in your preferred IDE or through the command line.
